# Custom Mining Dimensions Datapack
Using this to keep track of my changes/struggles

Trying to use the <a href="https://github.com/Crystal-Nest/server-sided-portals">Serverside Portals</a> mod to create a Minecraft 1.21.1 datapack that creates 3 custom dimensions, a desert, a badlands, and a caves biome, for the purposes of mining on an SMP.
